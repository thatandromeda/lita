                        <p>Hi!  I'm Andromeda Yelton, and I'm running for <a href="http://www.ala.org/lita/about/board">LITA Board of Directors</a>, as a Director at Large for 2013-2016.  The election will take place March 19 through April 26, 2013, via email.  I would really appreciate your vote.</p>

                                    I love technology because <a href="http://andromedayelton.com/blog/2012/08/28/why-should-librarians-learn-python-a-better-answer/">code lets you see</a> how to change the world for the better.  It empowers you, and empowerment is for everyone.  This means I want to use the vantage point of the Board as a way to see and connect the amazing people and projects that are already there: breathe sparks into fire.  It also means I want more librarians, and more diverse librarians, to improve their technological confidence and competence.  I want a LITA that represents a broad range of librarians, library types, and use cases, collaborating to build a better world.

                                    I started observing the Board because I didn't have a good answer to the question, "What is LITA?"  I still don't.  We need to do a better job articulating our value, which in turn will aid member attraction and retention.  The Board specifically needs to do a better job communicating to members, and soliciting communication from members, not only so that it can facilitate collaboration and professional development, but also so that it can be held accountable.  As a Board member, I would tell you what I'm doing, and I would ask you to tell me if it fell short of your expectations -- which I hope are high.  LITA members are some of the most creative, intelligent, dynamic, innovative, friendly, fun people I've ever met, and you deserve a stellar board.  I want to make it easy for you to demand and verify that you have one.

                                    I see Board service as an opportunity to be a steward of the tribe that has given so much to me.  This means facilitating the professional development and sense of personal reward we get from from association membership.  It also means safeguarding the association itself.  LITA has been spending down its reserves for years to cover shortfalls in its operating expenses, and this scares me.  The ALA budget process is complex and has a lot of moving pieces, not all of them under LITA's control; however, I would use Board membership to shine a light on these moving pieces and think creatively about how we can shift them.  I care about LITA decades from now as well as today.

                                Andromeda is wicked smart, hilariously insightful, and scary effective. I met her when I was the member-mentor for the 2011 ALA Emerging Leaders Team J project "ALA Timeline" which presents a graphical display of various ALA events, deadlines, and publications. Andromeda coded up the back-end of the display in Drupal at <a href="http://jaguars.andromedayelton.com">http://jaguars.andromedayelton.com</a>. She has been an active observer and participant in LITA Board meetings for several years, has the organizational skills needed to make the ideas and desires expressed there happen, and will be one of the most effective LITAns for years to come.

In the broader profession, she has been on the forefront of confronting some of the key issues that challenge libraries, as exemplified by her work for <a href="https://unglue.it">Unglue.it</a> to create an alternative business model for publishing.

I can assure you that she knows how to get things done and is always willing to put in the time and effort to move projects forward to completion.

                                <p>But beyond that -- and what sets Andromeda apart in my opinion-- is the deep humanity that infuses her thinking and writing.  Oh and she's very practical and reality-based.  Oh, and she writes with amazing style, clarity, and wit.  And did I mention she is kind and generous, and of good humor?</p>

                                <p>In short, I believe that Andromeda is one of the shining lights in our profession, continually adding value to our ongoing professional dialogue through her writings and postings.
